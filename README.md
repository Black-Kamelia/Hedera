## ü§î What is it?

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Hedera is currently in developement phase. As such, no stable release nor Docker image is available as of now.
>
> You can run a dev build using Docker with this image: [`bkamelia/hedera:nightly`](https://hub.docker.com/r/bkamelia/hedera) *(Updated every night GMT+1)*

**Hedera** is an open-source web application built with **[Ktor](https://ktor.io/)** and **[Nuxt 3](https://nuxt.com/)**.
It is the next iteration of [Selfish](https://github.com/SlamaFR/Selfish). Like its predecessor, it is highly inspired
by [XBackBone](https://github.com/SergiX44/XBackBone).

You can see Hedera like a self-hosted Imgur. You simply take screenshots and host them on your Hedera server.

> [!NOTE]
> Hedera is expected to be released soon. It will be shipped as a standalone JAR and a Docker image ready to deploy.

## ‚ú® Features

- **User accounts** ‚Äî You can create multiple accounts, or let users sign up.
  Each screenshots uploaded is bound to its user account.
- **Disk quota** ‚Äî You can set a disk quota not to exceed ; this way you can upload files without worrying about stuffing your disk completely.
  You can choose to set a custom quota for each user, or allow unlimited storage.
- **Auto-deletion** ‚Äî Imagine being unable to upload a fantastic screenshot because you're about to exceed your quota? No problem, auto-deletion will delete the oldest files to free some space.
- **[ShareX](https://getsharex.com/) integration** ‚Äî ShareX is an awesome open-source software to take screenshots or record your screen.
  You can download a [custom uploader](https://getsharex.com/docs/custom-uploader) file on your profile page to allow ShareX to upload your screenshots directly to your Hedera account.

## üõ† Installation

## üèóÔ∏è Building

### Front-end

Building the front-end is pretty straightforward. 
You just need to run the dedicated Gradle tasks.
This tasks install Node.js, sets everything up through pNPM and builds the front-end.

```bash
gradle client:build
```

### Back-end

Building the back-end is also very easy.
Simply run the default Gradle build task.
This task will compile the back-end and run the tests.

```bash
gradle server:build
```

### Full build

To build a complete production-ready JAR, run the package task.
This tasks bundles the front-end, and compiles the JAR using the shadow plugin.

```bash
gradle assemble
```
