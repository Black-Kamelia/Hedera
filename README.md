## ü§î What is it?

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Hedera is currently in developement phase. As such, no stable release nor Docker image is available as of now.
>
> You can run a dev build using Docker with this image: [`bkamelia/hedera:nightly`](https://hub.docker.com/r/bkamelia/hedera) *(Updated every night GMT+1)*

**Hedera** is an open-source web application built with **[Ktor](https://ktor.io/)** and **[Nuxt 3](https://nuxt.com/)**.
It is the next iteration of [Selfish](https://github.com/SlamaFR/Selfish). Like its predecessor, it is highly inspired
by [XBackBone](https://github.com/SergiX44/XBackBone).

You can see Hedera like a self-hosted Imgur. You simply take screenshots and host them on your Hedera server.

> [!NOTE]
> Hedera is expected to be released soon. It will be shipped as a standalone JAR and a Docker image ready to deploy.

## ‚ú® Features

- **User accounts**<br>
  You can create multiple accounts, or let users sign up.
  Each screenshots uploaded is bound to its user account.
- **Disk space quota**<br>
  You can set a disk quota not to exceed; this way you can upload files without worrying about stuffing your disk completely.
  You can choose to set a custom quota for each user, or allow unlimited storage.
- **Files visibility**<br>
  Uploaded a screenshot you would like to keep private? No problem, just change this one's visibility and you're done. Other files will get the default visibility you set.
- **Custom links**<br>
  Want to send your favorite meme but can't remember the random gigberish link? Set a custom link to type it directly.
- **Advanced filters**<br>
  A while back, you uploaded a file you're struggling to find again? Just set a bunch of filters to refine your search.
- **Third-party software integrations**<br>
  Use third-party applications to take screenshots and upload them directly to Hedera.<br>
  Supported: [ShareX](https://getsharex.com/), [uPic](https://github.com/gee1k/uPic), *Apple Shortcut (Coming soon)*

And a lot more to come later... Stay tuned üëÄ

## üèóÔ∏è Building

### Front-end

Building the front-end is pretty straightforward. 
You just need to run the dedicated Gradle tasks.
This tasks install Node.js, sets everything up through pNPM and builds the front-end.

```bash
gradle client:build
```

### Back-end

Building the back-end is also very easy.
Simply run the default Gradle build task.
This task will compile the back-end and run the tests.

```bash
gradle server:build
```

### Full build

To build a complete production-ready JAR, run the package task.
This tasks bundles the front-end, and compiles the JAR using the shadow plugin.

```bash
gradle assemble
```
