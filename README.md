## ü§î What is it?

**Hedera** is an open-source web application built with **[Ktor](https://ktor.io/)** and **[Nuxt 3](https://nuxt.com/)**.
It is the next iteration of [Selfish](https://github.com/SlamaFR/Selfish). Like its predecessor, it is highly inspired
by [XBackBone](https://github.com/SergiX44/XBackBone).

You can see Hedera like a self-hosted Imgur. You simply take screenshots and host them on your Hedera server.

But it's much more than that. It's also a file manager, and gallery editor and viewer !

üëâ YES. Hedera will also be shipped in a Docker image.

## ‚ú® Features

- **User accounts** ‚Äî You can create multiple accounts, or let users sign up.
  Each screenshots uploaded is bound to its user account.
- **Disk quota** ‚Äî You can set a disk quota not to exceed ; this way you can upload files without worrying about stuffing your disk completely.
  You can choose to set a custom quota for each user, or allow unlimited storage.
- **Auto-deletion** ‚Äî Imagine being unable to upload a fantastic screenshot because you're about to exceed your quota? No problem, auto-deletion will delete the oldest files to free some space.
- **[ShareX](https://getsharex.com/) integration** ‚Äî ShareX is an awesome open-source software to take screenshots or record your screen.
  You can download a [custom uploader](https://getsharex.com/docs/custom-uploader) file on your profile page to allow ShareX to upload your screenshots directly to your Hedera account.
